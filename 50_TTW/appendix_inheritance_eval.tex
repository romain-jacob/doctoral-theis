\section{System Configuration -- Scheduler Evaluation}
\label{append:inheritance_eval}

This appendix details the system configuration used for the performance evaluation of \TTW's scheduler~(\cref{sec:ttw_evaluation_sched}).
The configuration consists of 15 different applications involving 45 tasks and 30 messages, executing in 5 different modes~(\cref{table:modes}).
All applications are considered persistent, and the precedence graphs always contain a single chain.
The tasks are mapped to 13 different nodes~(\cref{table:mapping}), with a WCET set to 1\ms.
The mode graph is shown in~\cref{fig:modeGraph_eval}.
% All other inputs are set as reported in \cref{tab:ILPvar}.
