  abstract = {The paper presents an algorithm for offline scheduling of communicating tasks with precedence and exclusion constraints in distributed hard real time systems. Tasks are assumed to communicate via message passing based on a time bounded communication paradigm, such as the real time channel (D.D. Kandlur et al., 1994). The algorithm uses a branch-and-bound (B \& B) technique to search for a task schedule by minimizing maximum task lateness (defined as the difference between task completion time and task deadline), and exploits the interplay between task and message scheduling to improve the quality of solution. It generates a complete schedule at each vertex in the search tree, and can be made to yield a feasible schedule (found before reaching an optimal solution), or proceed until an optimal task schedule is found. We have conducted an extensive simulation study to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The algorithm is shown to scale well with respect to system size and degree of intertask interactions. It also offers good performance for workloads with a wide range of CPU utilizations and application concurrency. For larger systems and higher loads, we introduce a greedy heuristic that is faster but has no optimality properties. We have also extended the algorithm to a more general resource-constraint model, thus widening its application domain.},

Distributed consensus protocols is a mature field of research in a wired context, but has received little attention in low-power wireless settings. In this paper, we present A2: Agreement in the Air, a system that brings distributed consensus to low-power multi-hop networks. A2 introduces Synchrotron, a synchronous transmissions kernel that builds a robust mesh by exploiting the capture effect, frequency hopping with parallel channels, and link-layer security. A2 builds on top of this reliable base layer and enables the two- and three-phase commit protocols, as well as network services such as group membership, hopping sequence distribution and re-keying. We evaluate A2 on four public testbeds with different deployment densities and sizes. A2 requires only 475 ms to complete a two-phase commit over 180 nodes. The resulting duty cycle is 0.5\% for 1-minute intervals. We show that A2 achieves zero losses end-to-end over long experiments, representing millions of data points. When adding controlled failures, we show that two-phase commit ensures transaction consistency in A2 while three-phase commit provides liveness at the expense of inconsistency under specific failure scenarios.},

While it has been traditionally limited to peer-to-peer and star network topology, the recent Bluetooth 5 standard introduces new operating modes to allow for increased reliability and Bluetooth Mesh supports multi-hop networking based on message flooding. In this paper, we present BlueFlood. It adapts concurrent transmissions, as introduced by Glossy, to Bluetooth. The result is fast and efficient network-wide data dissemination in multi-hop Bluetooth networks. Moreover, we show that BlueFlood floods can be reliably received by offthe-shelf Bluetooth devices such as smartphones, opening new applications of concurrent transmissions and a seamless integration with existing technologies. We present an in-depth experimental feasibility study of concurrent transmissions over Bluetooth PHY in a controlled environment. Further, we build a small-scale testbed where we evaluate BlueFlood in real-world settings of a residential environment. We show that BlueFlood achieves 99\% end-toend delivery ratio in multi-hop networks with a duty cycle of 0.13\% for 1-second intervals.},

  author = {Azim, Akramul},
  year = {2014},
  abstract = {Real-time tasks require sufficient resources to meet deadline constraints. A component should provision sufficient resources for its workloads consisting of tasks to meet their deadlines. Supply and demand bound functions can be used to analyze the schedulability of workloads. The demand-bound function determines the maximum required computational units for a given workload and the supply-bound function determines the minimum possible resources supplied to the workload. A component will experience an overload if it receives fewer resources than required. An overload will be transient if it occurs for a bounded amount of time. Most work concentrates on designing components that avoid overloads by over-provisioning resources even though some computational units such as control system components can tolerate transient overloads. Overload-tolerant components can utilize resources more efficiently if over-provisioning of resources can be avoided. 
First, this dissertation presents the design of an efficient periodic resource model for scheduling computation of components that can tolerate transient overloads under the Earliest Deadline First (EDF) scheduling policy. We propose a periodic resource model for overload-tolerant components to address three problems: (1) characterize overloads and determine metrics of interest (i.e., delay), (2) derive a model to compute a periodic resource supply for a given workload and a worst-case tolerable delay, and (3) find a periodic resource supply for given control system specifications with a worst-case delay. The derived periodic resource supply can be used to derive an overload-tolerant component interface. Overload-tolerant real-time components can connect with each other in a distributed manner and thus require communication scheduling for reliable and guaranteed transmissions. Moreover, applications may require multi-mode communication for efficient data transmission. 
Second, this dissertation discusses communication schedules for multi-mode distributed components. Since distributed multi-mode applications are prone to suffer from delays incurred during mode changes, good communication schedules have low average mode-change delays. A key problem in designing multi-mode communication in real-time systems is the generation of schedules to move away the complexity of schedule design from the developer. We propose a mechanism to generate multi-mode communication schedules using optimization constraints associated with timing requirements. We illustrate a workflow from specifications to the generation of communication schedules through a real-time video monitoring case-study. Experimental analysis for the case-study demonstrates that schedules generated using the proposed method reduce the average mode-change delay compared to a randomized algorithm and the well-known EDF scheduling policy. 
Finally, this thesis discusses the synthesis of schedules for computation and communication to achieve not only performance but also separation of concerns for reducing complexity and increasing safety. To integrate overload-tolerant components using real-time communication, we derive specifications of component interfaces using the characterization of overloads and the proposed periodic resource model. The generation of communication schedules uses the specifications of interfaces which include timing requirements of possible transient overloads. A walk-through case-study explains the steps necessary to generate communication schedules using component interfaces. The interfaces provide safety through isolation of transient overload-tolerant components and the generated communication schedules provide high performance as a result of their low average mode-change delay.},

Glossy, an often used communication primitive to build such low-power wireless networks, is a flooding protocol providing high reliability and resilience. Even though the list of protocols building on top of Glossy is extensive, the current approach to implement Glossy-based protocols could be significantly improved by separating low-level complexity from high- level protocol logic. The Glossy Middleware presented in this thesis provides system designers with a well-defined, yet versatile interface. Building on top of a round-based framework, the Glossy Middleware offers a vast amount of control over important Glossy parameters on a high-level. This report presents the design and features of the Glossy Middleware in detail, while also serving as an user manual. The evaluation displays the low performance overhead in terms of memory and energy usage as well as the high usability by reimplementing different existing protocols in addition to others, illustrating the various features of the middleware. The middleware has been designed with hardware portability in mind: currently it is fully supported on the DPP platform and to some extent on the TelosB platform. This thesis concludes by illustrating possible improvements on the existing work while also outlining exiting possibilities of the developed Glossy Middle- ware.},

Recent research has extended this concept to IEEE 802.15.4 low-power wireless networks, which form a key component of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, the multiple traffic patterns necessary for SDN control makes it difficult to apply this approach to these highly challenging environments. This paper presents Atomic-SDN, a highly reliable and low-latency solution for SDN in low-power wireless. Atomic-SDN introduces a novel synchronous flooding (SF) architecture capable of dynamically configuring SF protocols to satisfy complex SDN control requirements, and draws from the authors' previous experiences in the IEEE EWSN Dependability Competition: where SF solutions have consistently outperformed other entries. Using this approach, Atomic-SDN presents considerable performance gains over other SDN implementations for low-power IoT networks. We evaluate the Atomic-SDN through simulation and experimentation, and show how utilizing SF techniques provides latency and reliability guarantees to SDN control operations as the local mesh scales. We compare the Atomic-SDN against the other SDN implementations based on the IEEE 802.15.4 network stack, and establish that the Atomic-SDN improves SDN control by orders-of-magnitude across latency, reliability and energy-efficiency metrics.},

  abstract = {Reproducible research---by its many names---has come to be regarded as a key concern across disciplines and stakeholder groups. Funding agencies and journals, professional societies and even mass media are paying attention, often focusing on the so-called "crisis" of reproducibility. One big problem keeps coming up among those seeking to tackle the issue: different groups are using terminologies in utter contradiction with each other. Looking at a broad sample of publications in different fields, we can classify their terminology via decision tree: they either, A---make no distinction between the words reproduce and replicate, or B---use them distinctly. If B, then they are commonly divided in two camps. In a spectrum of concerns that starts at a minimum standard of "same data+same methods=same results," to "new data and/or new methods in an independent study=same findings," group 1 calls the minimum standard reproduce, while group 2 calls it replicate. This direct swap of the two terms aggravates an already weighty issue. By attempting to inventory the terminologies across disciplines, I hope that some patterns will emerge to help us resolve the contradictions.},

Although bringing extended autonomy to battery powered stations, such technologies are known to be negatively influenced by similar technologies contending for the medium and, especially, by technologies using higher power transmissions over the same frequency bands. A frequency band that is becoming increasingly crowded with competing technologies is the 2.4GHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical band, encompassing, for example, Bluetooth and ZigBee, two low-power communication standards which are the base of several real-time protocols. Although these technologies employ mechanisms to improve their coexistence, they are still vulnerable to transmissions from uncoordinated stations with similar technologies or to higher power technologies such as Wi- Fi, which hinders the support of wireless dependable real-time communications in open environments. Therefore, this survey presents a comprehensive study of the most commonly used wireless low-power technologies operating in the 2.4GHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band and real-time protocols built upon them. The survey of the real-time protocols using these technologies is focused on factory automation applications, due to their more demanding timeliness and reliability requirements.},

  abstract = {The Dual Processor Platform (DPP) is a novel architecture template for networked embedded systems based on a strictly asynchronous processor interconnect that allows to minimize interference with a proven predictable behavior [7]. Contrary to traditional platforms [1, 5] DPP tries to mitigate interference by isolating different tasks and mapping them onto dedicated hardware resources. Typically, two different task sets - (i) sensing/actuation/data processing and (ii) communication - are mapped onto two different physically separated processing elements (usually low-power microcontrollers), allowing each to be optimized according to their individual requirements. Such hardware partitioning is a standard approach, frequently found in more complex sensor system implementations [2]. While the communication processor handles wireless packet transmission and reception, the application processor is dedicated to the sensor data acquisition, processing and actuation. But this strict separation of resources and function also requires a processor interconnect: BOLT [7], a stateful processor interconnect specifically designed based on this paradigm allows a strict decoupling of the power, clock and time domains of the two processing elements by allowing only asynchronous message passing between the two. The strict limitation to an asynchronous interface allows for predictable run-time behavior that, in addition to typical behavior observed from experiments, has been formally verified [7]. The most notable advantages of this approach are: Modularity Exchanging one of the components is hassle free and does not require a change to the other components. Simpler software The complexity of software development and validation is significantly reduced by task decoupling. Parallel development Development of the two separate entities can take place independently. Independent power management Each subsystem can take independent decisions on when to utilize low-power modes.},

  abstract = {With the recent surge in the interest for the Internet of Things (IoT) and an increased deployment of cyber-physical systems (CPS) in commercial and indus- trial applications, distributed systems have gained a significance influence on modern civilization and are performing increasingly complex tasks. Building such platforms in a reliable manner is challenging, as they include concurrent tasks on the application and the communication layers. As the majority of such devices features a single processor, tasked with both communicating over the network as well as sensing and computing, real-time scheduling conflicts arise as the resource separation of the applications in software is difficult to manage. To achieve such independence, we propose a platform consisting of dedicated application (AP) and communication (CP) processors which are completely de- coupled in terms of resource access, clock speeds and power management using BOLT. Leveraging this hardware separation, we then use the Distributed Real-time Protocol (DRP) to provably provide end-to-end real-time guaran- tees for the communication between distributed applications over a multi-hop wireless network. By establishing a set of contracts at run-time, DRP ensures that all messages reaching their destination meet their hard deadline. To demon- strate this, we implement the BLINK scheduler directly on the AP and adapt the LWB round structure to use DRP as a control layer protocol. We show that our system is capable of supporting several hundred simultaneous streams and can respond to requests in maximally 3 stream periods over up to 10 hops.},

An inadequate description of a claim can make it difficult to reason about the claim, for example, to determine whether the claim is sound. Many practitioners will acknowledge the threat of unsound claims or inadequate descriptions of claims to their field. We believe that this situation is exacerbated, and even encouraged, by the lack of a systematic approach to exploring, exposing, and addressing the source of unsound claims and poor exposition. This article proposes a framework that identifies three sins of reasoning that lead to unsound claims and two sins of exposition that lead to poorly described claims and evaluations. Sins of exposition obfuscate the objective of determining whether or not a claim is sound, while sins of reasoning lead directly to unsound claims. Our framework provides practitioners with a principled way of critiquing the integrity of their own work and the work of others. We hope that this will help individuals conduct better science and encourage a cultural shift in our research community to identify and promulgate sound claims.},

  abstract = {Observing the (social) behavior of animals and especially bats contributes to improved epidemic forecasts and improved protection of rare or endangered species. For this task, animal-borne sensor nodes are powerful tools since they allow collecting more information at less influence to the species compared to traditional radio telemetry. However, as bats are inherently small vertebrates, a strict weight limit of 2 g is dictated for attached sensor nodes. To acquire enough data, the sensor nodes must achieve a runtime of at least two weeks, which demands a rigorous energy management. As the data transmission is the most energy hungry task, minimizing the energy demand in this segment is a key to achieve the desired runtimes. In this paper we present a novel technique that enables bursts of erasure coded data without sacrificing reliability (in a wildlife setting). To keep data losses at a minimum, our approach exploits the characteristics of the erasure channel and combines encoded packets in smart way. We evaluated this approach extensively with experiments, field tests and a theoretical analysis. The results show a decreased energy demand by 30.177 \% to 36.951 \% while the data rate is increased up to a factor of 4 at the same time.},

A variety of MCPs are available in the literature; however, it can be difficult to tell which of them is the most suitable for a given application. This is because 1) existing work often evaluates MCPs analytically, without considering platform-specific overheads in a real deployment; 2) experimental evaluations, where available, tend to make very different choices in run-time environments and workloads, which hinders a direct comparison; and 3) practical applications often require at least some customization, which can completely invalidate the analysis and/or experimental evaluation of the underlying MCP. In this paper, we take a first step towards more principled comparisons. We identify a set of fundamental primitives that most MCPs tend to be built on, and we show that a variety of existing MCPs can be formulated by composing these primitives in different ways. We then present SafeMC, a system for specifying and evaluating current and new MCPs. SafeMC provides an easy-to-use specification language, a library of existing MCPs that can be customized by the user, as well as several tools for test generation, automatic evaluation, tracing, and performance analysis. To demonstrate the utlity of SafeMC, we use it to compare the performance of five classical MCPs in Xen. SafeMC is designed to be extensible and reusable, and we hope that it can serve as a building block for future research in this area.},

@article{ChineseWhispers,
  title = {Chinese Whispers},
  author = {{Wikipedia}},
  year = {2019},
  abstract = {Chinese whispers (Commonwealth English) or telephone (American English) is an internationally popular children's game  in which players form a line, and the first player comes up with a message and whispers it to the ear of the second person in the line. The second player repeats the message to the third player, and so on. When the last player is reached, they announce the message they heard to the entire group. The first person then compares the original message with the final version. Although the objective is to pass around the message without it becoming garbled along the way, part of the enjoyment is that, regardless, this usually ends up happening. Errors typically accumulate in the retellings, so the statement announced by the last player differs significantly from that of the first player, usually with amusing or humorous effect. Reasons for changes include anxiousness or impatience, erroneous corrections, the difficult-to-understand mechanism of whispering, and that some players may deliberately alter what is being said to guarantee a changed message by the end of the line.
The game is often played by children as a party game or on the playground.  It is often invoked as a metaphor for cumulative error, especially the inaccuracies as rumours or gossip spread, or, more generally, for the unreliability of human recollection or even oral traditions.},

Nevertheless, application development becomes more complex: the control logic must be embedded in the network, and coordination among multiple tasks is needed to achieve the application goals.This paper presents TeenyLime, a WSN middleware designed to address the above challenges. TeenyLime provides programmers with the high-level abstraction of a tuple space, enabling data sharing among neighboring devices. These and other WSN-specific constructs simplify the development of a wide range of applications, including sense-and-react ones. TeenyLime yields simpler, cleaner, and more reusable implementations, at the cost of only a very limited decrease in performance. We support these claims through a source-level, quantitative comparison between implementations based on TeenyLime and on mainstream approaches, and by analyzing measures of processing overhead and power consumption obtained through cycle-accurate emulation.},

However, in order to achieve end-to-end determinism at the application level, software tasks running on the end-system nodes need to obey a similar execution scheme with tight dependencies towards the network domain. In this paper we address the simultaneous co-synthesis of network as well as application schedules for preemptive time-triggered tasks communicating in a switched multi-speed time-triggered network. We use Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) to formulate the scheduling constraints and solve the resulting problem using a state-of-the-art SMT solver. Furthermore, we introduce a novel incremental scheduling approach, based on the demand bound test for asynchronous constrained-deadline periodic tasks, which significantly improves scalability for the average case without sacrificing schedulability. We demonstrate the performance of our approach using synthetic network topologies and system configurations.},

  abstract = {Ethernet-based time-triggered networks (e.g. TTEthernet) enable the cost-effective integration of safety-critical and real-time distributed applications in domains where determinism is a key requirement, like the aerospace, automotive, and industrial domains. Time-Triggered communication typically follows an offline and statically configured schedule (the synthesis of which is an NP-complete problem) guaranteeing contention-free frame transmissions. Extending the end-to-end determinism towards the application layers requires that software tasks running on end nodes are scheduled in tight relation to the underlying time-triggered network schedule. In this paper we discuss the simultaneous co-generation of static network and task schedules for distributed systems consisting of preemptive time-triggered tasks which communicate over switched multi-speed time-triggered networks. We formulate the schedule problem using first-order logical constraints and present alternative methods to find a solution, with or without optimization objectives, based on satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) and mixed integer programming (MIP) solvers, respectively. Furthermore, we present an incremental scheduling approach, based on the demand bound test for asynchronous tasks, which significantly improves the scalability of the scheduling problem. We demonstrate the performance of the approach with an extensive evaluation of industrial-sized synthetic configurations using alternative state-of-the-art SMT and MIP solvers and show that, even when using optimization, most of the problems are solved within reasonable time using the incremental method.},

The theory developed is different from traditional approaches to analyzing delay because the model used to describe the entry of data into the network is nonprobabilistic. It is supposed that the data stream entered into the network by any given user satisfies burstiness constraints. A data stream is said to satisfy a burstiness constraint if the quantity of data from the stream contained in any interval of time is less than a value that depends on the length of the interval. Several network elements are defined that can be used as building blocks to model a wide variety of communication networks. Each type of network element is analyzed by assuming that the traffic entering it satisfies bursting constraints. Under this assumption, bounds are obtained on delay and buffering requirements for the network element; burstiness constraints satisfied by the traffic that exits the element are derived},

Pando encodes data by Fountain codes and disseminates the rateless stream of encoded packets along the fast and parallel pipelines built on constructive interference and channel diversity. Since every encoded packet contains innovative information to the original data object, Pando avoids duplicate retransmissions and fully exploits the wireless broadcast effect in data dissemination. To transform Pando into a practical system, we devise several techniques, including the integration of Fountain coding with the timing-critical operations of constructive interference and pipelining, a silence based feedback scheme for the one-way pipelined dissemination, and packet-level adaptation of network density and channel diversity. Based on these techniques, Pando can accomplish the data dissemination process entirely over the fast and parallel pipelines. We implement Pando in Contiki and for TelosB sensor motes. We evaluate Pando's performance with various settings on two large-scale open testbeds, Indriya and Flocklab. Our experimental results show that Pando can provide 100\% reliability and reduce the dissemination time of the state-of-the-art by 3.5.},

We show that protothreads significantly reduce the complexity of a number of widely used programs previously written with event-driven state machines. For the examined programs the majority of the state machines could be entirely removed. In the other cases the number of states and transitions was drastically decreased. With protothreads the number of lines of code was reduced by one third. The execution time overhead of protothreads is on the order of a few processor cycles.},

  abstract = {Time slotted operation is a well-proven approach to achieve highly reliable low-power networking through scheduling and channel hopping. It is, however, difficult to apply time slotting to dynamic networks as envisioned in the Internet of Things. Commonly, these applications do not have pre-defined periodic traffic patterns and nodes can be added or removed dynamically. This paper addresses the challenge of bringing TSCH (Time Slotted Channel Hopping MAC) to such dynamic networks. We focus on low-power IPv6 and RPL networks, and introduce Orchestra. In Orchestra, nodes autonomously compute their own, local schedules. They maintain multiple schedules, each allocated to a particular traffic plane (application, routing, MAC), and updated automatically as the topology evolves. Orchestra (re)computes local schedules without signaling overhead, and does not require any central or distributed scheduler. Instead, it relies on the existing network stack information to maintain the schedules. This scheme allows Orchestra to build non-deterministic networks while exploiting the robustness of TSCH. We demonstrate the practicality of Orchestra and quantify its benefits through extensive evaluation in two testbeds, on two hardware platforms. Orchestra reduces, or even eliminates, network contention. In long running experiments of up to 72\textasciitilde{}h we show that Orchestra achieves end-to-end delivery ratios of over 99.99\%. Compared to RPL in asynchronous low-power listening networks, Orchestra improves reliability by two orders of magnitude, while achieving a similar latency-energy balance.},

  abstract = {After a decade of research in low-power data collection, reaching arbitrary nodes has received comparatively little attention. The leading protocol for low-power IPv6 routing, RPL, is no exception, as it is often studied in multipoint-to-point scenarios. As a result, downward routing (from root to node) is still notoriously difficult, holding back the emergence of Internet of Things applications that involve actuation. In this paper, we focus on achieving industrial-grade reliability levels (1e-5 failure rate) in downward routing with RPL. We make every packet count, and classify the different causes of packet loss. We show how to mitigate each source of packet loss, by (1) introducing a gradient metric that favors reliable links, (2) increasing neighborhood awareness for accurate link selection, and (3) ensuring a robust routing state maintenance and packet forwarding. We demonstrate RPL downward routing with loss rates in the order of 1e-5 in four different testbeds up to 352 nodes, in both sparse and dense settings. We also validate our solution on top of a low-power TSCH scheduler, and achieve sub-percent low duty cycles and a channel utilization of 0.07\% at every node, spread over 16 channels.},

In contrast, non-coherent frequency receivers offer a very robust behavior. CT applicability in IEEE 802.15.4 is mainly because of two factors: transmissions are usually demodulated as non-coherent MSK (as opposed to coherent OQPSK) and the Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS), that helps minimizing the error rate.},

Glossy exploits constructive interference of IEEE 802.15.4 symbols for fast network flooding and implicit time synchronization. We derive a timing requirement to make concurrent transmissions of the same packet interfere constructively, allowing a receiver to decode the packet even in the absence of capture effects. To satisfy this requirement, our design temporally decouples flooding from other network activities. We analyze Glossy using a mixture of statistical and worst-case models, and evaluate it through experiments under controlled settings and on three wireless sensor testbeds. Our results show that Glossy floods packets within a few milliseconds and achieves an average time synchronization error below one microsecond. In most cases, a node receives the flooding packet with a probability higher than 99.99\%, while having its radio turned on for only a few milliseconds during a flood. Moreover, unlike existing flooding schemes, Glossy's performance exhibits no noticeable dependency on node density, which facilitates its application in diverse real-world settings.},

Deployed systems must therefore provide highly dependable operation against unpredictable real-world dynamics. However, common CPS hardware-comprising battery-powered and severely resource-constrained devices interconnected via low-power wireless-greatly complicates attaining the required communication guarantees. VIRTUS fills this gap by providing atomic multicast and view management atop resource-constrained devices, which together provide virtually synchronous executions that developers can leverage to apply established concepts from the dependable distributed systems literature. We build VIRTUS upon an existing best-effort communication layer, and formally prove the functional correctness of our mechanisms. We further show, through extensive real-world experiments, that VIRTUS incurs a limited performance penalty compared with best-effort communication. To the best of our knowledge, VIRTUS is the first system to provide virtual synchrony guarantees atop resource-constrained CPS hardware.},

The main goals of this paper were to: (a) formulate an updated Minimum Requirements Report for pollen monitoring; (b) carry out a pilot QC exercise of staff involved in pollen counting from various national networks in order to examine between analysts reproducibility and develop a methodology that can be used in future QC exercises. A questionnaire survey was sent to coordinators of participating pollen monitoring networks. In addition, a total of 45 technicians from 15 European countries participated in the pilot QC exercise. All technicians were instructed to analyse two slides containing the following pollen types: (a) Poaceae and Betula pollen grains in the north of Europe; (b) Poaceae and Olea pollen grains in the south of Europe. Minimum Recommendations were produced based on the results of the questionnaire survey, published literature, and the outcomes of a workshop. In the QC exercise, it was noticed that technicians who followed the Minimum Recommendations and examined at least 10 \% of the slide tended to have better indicators of precision and accuracy than those technicians who did not follow the Minimum Recommendations. The proposed Minimum Recommendations will help to improve the quality of scientific work, particularly for those who are considering the setting up of new monitoring sites. The results of the pilot QC exercise will help to develop a methodology that can be used again in the future, thereby ensuring data quality.},

PREAcT'S design combines strategic long-term planning of future energy utilization with feedback control to compensate for deviations from the expected conditions. We implement Pre-act on a low-power microcontroller and compare it against the state of the art on multiple years of real-world data. Our results demonstrate that PREAcT is up to 53 \% more effective in utilizing harvested solar energy and significantly more robust to uncertainties and inefficiencies of practical systems. These gains translate into an improvement of 28 \% in the end-to-end performance of a real-world application we investigate when using PREAcT.},

As such, existing OAP protocols become decidedly inefficient (with respect to energy, communication or delay) in unreliable broadcast environments, such as those with relatively high node density or noise. In this paper, we consider OAP approaches based on rateless codes, which significantly improve OAP in such environments by drastically reducing the need for packet rebroadcasting. We thus design and implement two rateless OAP protocols, rateless Deluge and ACKless Deluge, both of which replace the data transfer mechanism of the established OAP Deluge protocol with rateless analogs. Experiments with Tmote Sky motes on single-hop networks with packet loss rates of 7\% show these protocols to save significantly in communication over regular Deluge (roughly 15-30\% savings in the data plane, and 50-80\% in the control plane), and multi-hop experiments reveal similar trends. Simulations further shows that our new protocols scale better than standard Deluge (in terms of communication and energy) to high network density. TinyOS code for our implementation can be found at http://nislab.bu.edu.},

Mixer integrates random linear network coding (RLNC) with synchronous transmissions and approaches the order-optimal scaling in the number of messages to be exchanged. To achieve an efficient operation in real networks, we design Mixer in response to the theory of RLNC and the characteristics of physical-layer capture. Our experiments demonstrate, for example, that Mixer outperforms the state of the art by up to 3.8x and provides a reliability greater than 99.99 \% even at a node moving speed of 60 km/h.},

The message scheduling is one of the major design challenges in TTNoC-based systems. The designers not only need to allocate time slots but also have to assign communication routes for all messages. This paper tackles the TTNoC scheduling problem and presents an approach based on Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solving. We first formulate the complete problem as an SMT instance, which can always compute a feasible solution if exists. Thereafter, we propose an incremental approach that integrates SMT solving into classical heuristic algorithms. The experimental results show that the heuristic scales significantly better with only minor loss of performance.},

Given the limited number of license-free Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) radio bands, wireless technologies end up competing with one another for the wireless spectrum. As such, the proper employment of Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols is essential to guarantee efficient and reliable wireless communication. At the data link level, there has been extensive research towards programmable and more future-proof MAC protocols (e.g., Software-Defined Radios (SDRs), which enable to reconfigure the entire protocol and hence access/control fine-grained radio functionalities). However, actual deployments are so far limited because of performance issues and cost. With the increasing popularity of Software-Defined Networking (SDN), also in the wireless domain, and the increasing performance of SDRs, we are evolving into a fully programmable data link layer. In this survey, we deliver: a landscape of the state-of-the-art on programmable MAC protocols; a coherent terminology that represents scope and level of programmability supported; an in-depth study of their advantages and disadvantages; and a discussion about future research challenges on MAC programmability. Many surveys have investigated the use of specific MAC protocols for a wide range of optimization criteria and application demands. This survey is the first that investigates the scope and the level of programmability that MAC protocols support.},

The recent Crystal system uses synchronous transmissions to support aperiodic traffic with near-perfect reliability, low latency, and ultra-low power consumption. However, its performance is known under mild interference---a concern, as Crystal relies heavily on the (noise-sensitive) capture effect and targets aperiodic traffic where "every packet counts". We exploit a 49-node indoor testbed where, in contrast to existing evaluations using only naturally present interference to evaluate synchronous systems, we rely on JamLab to generate noise patterns that are not only more disruptive and extensive, but also reproducible. We show that a properly configured, unmodified Crystal yields perfect reliability (unlike Glossy) in several noise scenarios, but cannot sustain extreme ones (e.g., an emulated microwave oven near the sink) that instead are handled by routing-based approaches. We extend Crystal with techniques known to mitigate interference---channel hopping and noise detection---and demonstrate that these allow Crystal to achieve performance akin to the original even under multiple sources of strong interference.},

Our evaluation shows a reduction of communication latency by a factor 2x and of energy consumption by 33-40\% compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Specifically, RPL is designed to be a simple and inter-operable networking protocol for resource-constrained devices in industrial, home, and urban environments, intended to support the vision of the Internet of Things with thousands of devices interconnected through multihop mesh networks. More than four-years have passed since the standardization of RPL, and we believe that it is time to examine and understand its current state. In this paper, we review the history of research efforts in RPL; what aspects have been (and have not been) investigated and evaluated, how they have been studied, what was (and was not) implemented, and what remains for future investigation. We reviewed over 97 RPL-related academic research papers published by major academic publishers and present a topic-oriented survey for these research efforts. Our survey shows that only 40.2\% of the papers evaluate RPL through experiments using implementations on real embedded devices, ContikiOS and TinyOS are the two most popular implementations (92.3\%), and TelosB was the most frequently used hardware platform (69\%) on testbeds that have average and median size of 49.4 and 30.5 nodes, respectively. Furthermore, unfortunately, despite it being approximately four years since its initial standardization, we are yet to see wide adoption of RPL as part of real-world systems and applications. We present our observations on the reasons behind this and suggest directions on which RPL should evolve.},

Building new MAC protocols has proven to be extremely difficult, however, given the monolithic nature of existing protocol implementations as well as their dependence on a particular radio or processor platform. To address these issues, we propose the MAC Layer Architecture (MLA), a component-based architecture for power-efficient MAC protocol development in wireless sensor networks. MLA consists of optimized, reusable components that implement a common set of features shared by existing MAC protocols, as well as abstractions that encapsulate the intricacies of the hardware platforms they run on. Through an instantiation of MLA in TinyOS 2.0.1, we have implemented five representative MAC protocols. Empirical results show that MLA results in significant code reuse among different protocols, while achieving comparative performance and memory footprints to monolithic implementations of the same protocols.},

Because these wireless devices are often battery powered, we need specific energy efficient (low-power) solutions. Moreover, these smart objects use low-cost hardware with possibly weak links, leading to a lossy network. Once deployed, these Low-power Lossy Networks (LLNs) are intended to collect the expected measurements, handle transient faults and topology changes, etc. Consequently, validation and verification during the protocol development are a matter of prime importance. A large range of theoretical or practical tools are available for performance evaluation. A theoretical analysis may demonstrate that the performance guarantees are respected, while simulations or experiments aim on estimating the behaviour of a set of protocols within real-world scenarios. In this article, we review the various parameters that should be taken into account during such a performance evaluation. Our primary purpose is to provide a tutorial that specifies guidelines for conducting performance evaluation campaigns of network protocols in LLNs. We detail the general approach adopted in order to evaluate the performance of layer 2 and 3 protocols in LLNs. Furthermore, we also specify the methodology that should be adopted during the performance evaluation, while reviewing the numerous models and tools that are available to the research community.},

We show that this design enables a variety of common all-to-all interactions, including network-wide agreement and data aggregation. Results from three testbeds and simulations demonstrate that Chaos scales efficiently to networks consisting of hundreds of nodes, achieving severalfold improvements over LWB and CTP/Drip in radio duty cycle and latency with almost 100 \% reliability across all scenarios we tested. For example, Chaos computes simple aggregates, such as the maximum, in a 100-node multi-hop network within less than 90 milliseconds.},

  abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) are integrations of computation and physical processes. Embedded computers and networks monitor and control the physical processes, usually with feedback loops where physical processes affect computations and vice versa. The economic and societal potential of such systems is vastly greater than what has been realized, and major investments are being made worldwide to develop the technology. There are considerable challenges, particularly because the physical components of such systems introduce safety and reliability requirements qualitatively different from those in general- purpose computing. Moreover, physical components are qualitatively different from object-oriented software components. Standard abstractions based on method calls and threads do not work. This paper examines the challenges in designing such systems, and in particular raises the question of whether today's computing and networking technologies provide an adequate foundation for CPS. It concludes that it will not be sufficient to improve design processes, raise the level of abstraction, or verify (formally or otherwise) designs that are built on today's abstractions. To realize the full potential of CPS, we will have to rebuild computing and networking abstractions. These abstractions will have to embrace physical dynamics and computation in a unified way.},

While existing testbeds provide ample opportunities for realistic, large-scale experiments, they are limited in their ability to closely observe and control the distributed operation of resource-constrained nodes - access to the nodes is restricted to the serial port. This paper presents FlockLab, a testbed that overcomes this limitation by allowing multiple services to run simultaneously and synchronously against all nodes under test in addition to the traditional serial port service: tracing of GPIO pins to record logical events occurring on a node, actuation of GPIO pins to trigger actions on a node, and high-resolution power profiling. FlockLab's accurate timing information in the low microsecond range enables logical events to be correlated with power samples, thus providing a previously unattained level of visibility into the distributed behavior of wireless embedded systems. In this paper, we describe FlockLab's design, benchmark its performance, and demonstrate its capabilities through several real-world test cases.},

  abstract = {Sensor networks are long-running computer systems with many sensing/compute nodes working to gather information about their environment, process and fuse that information, and in some cases, actuate control mechanisms in response. Like traditional parallel systems, communication between nodes is of fundamental importance, but is typically accomplished via wireless transceivers. One further key attribute of sensor networks is that they are almost always long running systems, intended to operate in situ, with minimal direct human intervention, for months or years. This requirement for long-running autonomy mandates careful design of the runtime system that manages applications on each node, to ensure reliability and ease of upgrades over the life of the system.This paper describes Impala, a middleware architecture that enables application modularity, adaptivity, and repair-ability in wireless sensor networks. Impala allows software updates to be received via the node's wireless transceiver and to be applied to the running system dynamically. In addition, Impala also provides an interface for on-the-fly application adaptation in order to improve the performance, energy-efficiency, and reliability of the software system. Impala has been designed to be a part of the ZebraNet mobile sensor network, but we are also prototyping it within HP/Compaq iPAQ Pocket PC handhelds. We present performance data for both real system measurements of the Pocket PC version as well as simulations of a full mobile sensor system deployment. Overall, Impala is a lightweight runtime system that can greatly improve system reliability, performance, and energy-efficiency. The ideas introduced here for sensor networks have applicability more broadly in other long-running autonomous parallel systems as well.},

Novel location-addressed communication models are supported by a scalable and light-weight network stack.

We show that this policy is particularly suitable for communication scheduling in sensor networks in which a large number of wireless devices are seamlessly integrated into a physical space to perform real-time monitoring and control. Detailed simulations of representative sensor network environments demonstrate that RAP significantly reduces the end-to-end deadline miss ratio in the sensor network.},

In this paper, we consider the problem of designing a high-performance wireless network for industrial control, targeting at Gbps data rates and 10-{$\mu$}s-level cycle time. To this aim, we start from analyzing the required performance and deployment scenarios, then we take a look at the most advanced standards and emerging trends that may be applicable.

Low-power wireless technology is preferred for its low cost, small form factor, and flexibility, especially if the devices support multi-hop communication. So far, however, feedback control over wireless multi-hop networks has only been shown for update intervals on the order of seconds. This paper presents a wireless embedded system that tames imperfections impairing control performance (e.g., jitter and message loss), and a control design that exploits the essential properties of this system to provably guarantee closed-loop stability for physical processes with linear time-invariant dynamics. Using experiments on a cyber-physical testbed with 20 wireless nodes and multiple cart-pole systems, we are the first to demonstrate and evaluate feedback control and coordination over wireless multi-hop networks for update intervals of 20 to 50 milliseconds.},

Our work is motivated by the observation that capture effect can improve the reliability of synchronous transmission. We experimentally study the effect of physical layer capture and identify guidelines in which it can be exploited to enhance reliability. Based on these observations, we propose Syncast, a data dissemination protocol that improves over Glossy by exploiting capture effect over multichannels. The evaluation shows that Syncast provides a robust, reliable, and scalable data dissemination of large packets with lower end-to-end delay and up to 92\% reduced radio-on-time.},

  abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are increasingly proposed for applications characterized by many-to-many communication, where multiple sources report their data to multiple sinks. Unfortunately, mainstream WSN collection protocols are generally designed to account for a single sink and, dually, WSN multicast protocols optimize communication from a single source. In this paper, we present MUSTER, a routing protocol expressly designed for many-to-many communication. First, we devise an analytical model to compute, in a centralized manner, the optimal solution to the problem of simultaneously routing from multiple sources to multiple sinks. Next, we illustrate heuristics approximating the optimal solution in a distributed setting, and their implementation in MUSTER. To increase network lifetime, MUSTER minimizes the number of nodes involved in many-to-many routing and balances their forwarding load. We evaluate MUSTER in emulation and in a real WSN testbed. Results indicate that our protocol builds near-optimal routing paths, doubles the WSN lifetime, and overall delivers to the user 2.5 times the amount of raw data w.r.t. mainstream protocols. Moreover, MUSTER is intrinsically amenable to in-network aggregation, pushing the improvements up to a 180 percent increase in lifetime and a four-time increase in data yield.},

Unfortunately, it is still non-trivial to coordinate multiple drones to perform a task collaboratively. We present a novel programming model called team-level programming that can express collaborative sensing tasks without exposing the complexity of managing multiple drones, such as concurrent programming, parallel execution, scaling, and failure recovering. We create the Voltron programming system to explore the concept of team-level programming in active sensing applications. Voltron offers programming constructs to create the illusion of a simple sequential execution model while still maximizing opportunities to dynamically re-task the drones as needed. We implement Voltron by targeting a popular aerial drone platform, and evaluate the resulting system using a combination of real deployments, user studies, and emulation. Our results indicate that Voltron enables simpler code and produces marginal overhead in terms of CPU, memory, and network utilization. In addition, it greatly facilitates implementing correct and complete collaborative drone applications, compared to existing drone programming systems.},

The deployment and maintenance of such cabled systems is expensive and inflexible. It is, therefore, desirable to replace or augment these systems using wireless technology, which requires us to overcome significant technical challenges. Process automation and control applications are mission-critical and require timely and reliable data delivery, which is difficult to provide in industrial environments with harsh radio environments. In this article, we present the GINSENG system which implements performance control to allow us to use wireless sensor networks for mission-critical applications in industrial environments. GINSENG is a complete system solution that comprises on-node system software, network protocols, and back-end systems with sophisticated data processing capability. GINSENG assumes that a deployment can be carefully planned. A TDMA-based MAC protocol, tailored to the deployment environment, is employed to provide reliable and timely data delivery. Performance debugging components are used to unintrusively monitor the system performance and identify problems as they occur. The article reports on a real-world deployment of GINSENG in an especially challenging environment of an operational oil refinery in Sines, Portugal. We provide experimental results from this deployment and share the experiences gained. These results demonstate the use of GINSENG for sensing and actuation and allow an assessment of its ability to operate within the required performance bounds. We also identify shortcomings that manifested during the evaluation phase, thus giving a useful perspective on the challenges that have to be overcome in these harsh application settings.},

Access to these sensors and their networks is, unfortunately, often provided via proprietary protocols and data formats. To overcome such issues, middleware components have been employed to provide a universal interface to the sensor networks, hiding vendor-specific details. Recently, much attention in literature is aimed at what we define as 'centralised' middleware components, which consider sensor networks that have no capacity to run middleware components on the sensor nodes. In this paper we introduce the term 'centralised' for these middleware components, and illustrate their relevance using a literature review of existing middleware components. After an overview of their general architectural setup, we describe and discuss four important centralised middleware components. Finally, we identify directions of further research that will impact centralised middleware components in the near future.},

We propose cross-level simulation, a novel type of wireless sensor network simulation that enables holistic simultaneous simulation at different levels.

Additionally, extensions to the basic functionality must be separately implemented in each MAC protocol. In this paper, we look at a different way to design a MAC protocol, focusing on the providing of interfaces which can be used to implement the common functionality separately. This leaves the core of the MAC protocol, determining only when to send, which is substantially different for each protocol. We also look at some examples of MAC extensions that this approach enables. We demonstrate a working implementation of these principles as an implementation of B-MAC for TinyOS, and compare it with the standard TinyOS B-MAC implementation. We show a 35\% smaller code size, with the same overall functionality but increased extensibility, and while maintaining similar performance. We also present results and experiences from using the same framework to implement T-MAC, LMAC, and Crankshaft. All are demonstrated with data from real-world experience using our 24 node testbed.},

Swarms of robots or sensors and actuators in industrial closed-loop control need to coordinate within short periods of time to execute tasks. Failing to agree on a common decision can cause substantial consequences, like system failures and threats to human life. Such applications require consensus algorithms to enable coordination. While consensus has been studied for wired networks decades ago, with, for example, Paxos and Raft, it remains an open problem in multi-hop low-power wireless networks due to the limited resources available and the high cost of established solutions. This paper presents Wireless Paxos, a fault-tolerant, network-wide consensus primitive for low-power wireless networks. It is a new flavor of Paxos, the most-used consensus protocol today, and is specifically designed to tackle the challenges of low-power wireless networks. By building on top of concurrent transmissions, it provides low-latency, high reliability, and guarantees on the consensus. Our results show that Wireless Paxos requires only 289 ms to complete a consensus between 188 nodes in testbed experiments. Furthermore, we show that Wireless Paxos stays consistent even when injecting controlled failures.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) envisages a future in which digital and physical things or objects (e.g., smartphones, TVs, cars) can be connected by means of suitable information and communication technologies, to enable a range of applications and services. The IoT's characteristics, including an ultra-large-scale network of things, device and network level heterogeneity, and large numbers of events generated spontaneously by these things, will make development of the diverse applications and services a very challenging task. In general, middleware can ease a development process by integrating heterogeneous computing and communications devices, and supporting interoperability within the diverse applications and services. Recently, there have been a number of proposals for IoT middleware. These proposals mostly addressed wireless sensor networks (WSNs), a key component of IoT, but do not consider RF identification (RFID), machine-to-machine (M2M) communications, and supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA), other three core elements in the IoT vision. In this paper, we outline a set of requirements for IoT middleware, and present a comprehensive review of the existing middleware solutions against those requirements. In addition, open research issues, challenges, and future research directions are highlighted.},

  abstract = {Networked systems are often evaluated on overlay testbeds such as PlanetLab and emulation testbeds such as Emulab. Emulation testbeds give users great control over the host and network environments and offer easy reproducibility, but only artificial network conditions. Overlay testbeds provide real network conditions, but are not repeatable environments and provide less control over the experiment. We describe the motivation, design, and implementation of Flexlab, a new testbed with the strengths of both overlay and emulation testbeds. It enhances an emulation testbed by providing the ability to integrate a wide variety of network models, including those obtained from an overlay network. We present three models that demonstrate its usefulness, including "application-centric Internet modeling" that we specifically developed for Flexlab. Its key idea is to run the application within the emulation testbed and use its offered load to measure the overlay network. These measurements are used to shape the emulated network. Results indicate that for evaluation of applications running over Internet paths, Flexlab with this model can yield far more realistic results than either PlanetLab without resource reservations, or Emulab without topological information.},

  abstract = {Repeating research in computer science requires more than just code and data: it requires an appropriate environment in which to run experiments. In some cases, this environment appears fairly straightforward: it consists of a particular operating system and set of required libraries. In many cases, however, it is considerably more complex: the execution environment may be an entire network, may involve complex and fragile configuration of the dependencies, or may require large amounts of resources in terms of computation cycles, network bandwidth, or storage. Even the "straightforward" case turns out to be surprisingly intricate: there may be explicit or hidden dependencies on compilers, kernel quirks, details of the ISA, etc. The result is that when one tries to repeat published results, creating an environment sufficiently similar to one in which the experiment was originally run can be troublesome; this problem only gets worse as time passes. What the computer science community needs, then, are environments that have the explicit goal of enabling repeatable research. This paper outlines the problem of repeatable research environments, presents a set of requirements for such environments, and describes one facility that attempts to address them.},

Salient features of a WirelessHART network include a centralized network management architecture, multi-channel TDMA transmission, redundant routes, and avoidance of spatial reuse of channels for enhanced reliability and real-time performance. This paper makes several key contributions to real-time transmission scheduling in WirelessHART networks: (1) formulation of the end-to-end real-time transmission scheduling problem based on the characteristics of WirelessHART, (2) proof of NP-hardness of the problem, (3) an optimal branch-and-bound scheduling algorithm based on a necessary condition for schedulability, and (4) an efficient and practical heuristic-based scheduling algorithm called Conflict-aware Least Laxity First (C-LLF). Extensive simulations based on both random topologies and real network topologies of a physical testbed demonstrate that C-LLF is highly effective in meeting end-to-end deadlines in WirelessHART networks, and significantly outperforms common real-time scheduling policies.},

End-to-end communication delay analysis for WirelessHART networks is required to determine the schedulability of real-time data flows from sensors to actuators for the purpose of acceptance test or workload adjustment in response to network dynamics. In this paper, we consider a network model based on WirelessHART, and map the scheduling of real-time periodic data flows in the network to real-time multiprocessor scheduling. We then exploit the response time analysis for multiprocessor scheduling and propose a novel method for the delay analysis that establishes an upper bound of the end-to-end communication delay of each real-time flow in the network. Simulation studies based on both random topologies and real network topologies of a 74-node physical wireless sensor network testbed demonstrate that our analysis provides safe and reasonably tight upper bounds of the end-to-end delays of real-time flows, and hence enables effective schedulability tests for WirelessHART networks.},

  abstract = {Typical Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) deployments use more nodes than needed to accurately sense the phenomena of interest. This redundancy can be leveraged by switching-on only a subset of nodes at any time instant (node-scheduling) and putting the remaining nodes sleep. This effectively extends the network lifetime. In addition to sensing coverage, node-scheduling schemes must also ensure that (i) the network stays connected, and (ii) the time needed to wake-up the complete protocol stack after sleeping is minimized. We present Sleeping Beauty, a highly-efficient data collection protocol that aids node-scheduling schemes in both aspects. Sleeping Beauty uses a slotted and tightly synchronized communication primitive, where a node keeps its radio off for most of the time, except in the slots when it needs to participate for successful communication. Further, an efficient neighbor-discovery mechanism is included that provides partial, but sufficient topology information (potential parents) to avoid network partitions. Furthermore, Sleeping Beauty employs a novel, yet simple clock-offset estimation technique that maintains highly-accurate time synchronization over long radio-off periods (i.e., less than 500 us deviation even after 45, min of sleeping). This minimizes time wasted in resynchronizing the network in between data collection rounds. Through experiments on two different testbeds, we verified that Sleeping Beauty decreases the duty cycle up to a factor of 3 compared to state-of-the-art techniques, while achieving similar delivery ratios.},

Recent years have shown an increasing awareness about reproducibility of results as an essential part of research carried out by members of the ACM SIGCOMM community. To address this important issue, ACM has introduced a new policy on results and artifacts review and badging. The policy defines the terminology to be used to assess results and artifacts but does not specify the review process or how to make research reproducible. During SIGCOMM'17 a side workshop has been organized with the specific purpose to tackle this issue. The objective being to trigger discussion and activity in order to craft recommendations on how to introduce incentives for authors to share their artifacts, and the details on how to use them, as well as defining the process to be used.

  abstract = {With the rapid expansion of the Internet of Things, an increasing number of applications relies on reliable, energy-efficient, and low-latency communication between small networked wireless devices. A large number of wireless communication protocols dealing with these challenges have been proposed in recent years. Their performance typically varies greatly with the application and environment they are used in. The EWSN Dependability Competition aims to achieve some comparability between solutions by evaluating a protocols under the same conditions. To encourage protocols that are as generally applicable as possible, the 2019 edition introduces some controlled variation to the evaluation conditions. Traditionally, designing and implementing a communication protocol that provides good performance in such a complex scenario required a deep understanding of the entire communication stack used by the nodes as well as a large amount of development time.  Our goal in this project is to show that this is no longer the case thanks to Baloo, a novel design framework for communication protocols based on Synchronous Transmissions. We demonstrate this by participating in the 2019 EWSN Dependability Competition with our own protocol based on Baloo, which was developed and implemented within just a few weeks by students with little prior experience in the field of wireless networks. Early testing during the preparation phase of the competition has indicated that our protocol should be able to deliver comparable performance to other competing solutions in terms of reliability, latency and energy consumption across some input conditions.},

However, their level of dependability has rarely been benchmarked under the same settings and environmental conditions. In this paper we present the execution and results of a competition aimed to evaluate the dependability of state-of-the-art low-power wireless protocols under the same settings, and push their performance to the limit. We define a scenario emulating the operation of a wireless sensor network in industrial environments rich with radio interference and compare the end-to-end dependability of systems based on protocol strategies ranging from adaptive and time-slotted frequency-hopping to multi-modal routing and flooding. To increase fairness and realism, we allow the developers of the competing protocols to interact with the benchmarking infrastructure and optimize the protocol parameters for the scenario at hand. We achieve this by designing, implementing, and employing D-Cube, a low-cost tool that allows to accurately measure key dependability metrics such as end-to-end delay, reliability, and power consumption, as well as to graphically visualize their evolution in real-time. This interaction with the benchmarking infrastructure and the competitiveness of the event have incited the developers to push the performance of their protocols to the limit and reach impressive results.},

In a first attempt towards a rigorous comparison of protocol performance under the exact same settings, we have developed in 2016 a prototype benchmarking infrastructure called D-Cube, and used it to run the first of a series of competitions aiming to quantitatively assess the performance of low-power wireless protocols in specific scenarios. Given the success of the competition among both academia and industry, we have significantly extended the benchmarking infrastructure in the following two editions: D-Cube now also supports, among others, remote experimentation, multiple traffic patterns and loads, a custom description of how to derive performance metrics, and is further able to control the network density as well as the harshness of the RF environment. In this paper we perform a critical analysis of the current capabilities of D-Cube and argue that its main limiting factor is that the traffic patterns and node identities are manually embedded in the source code by developers and cannot be changed automatically. We show that we can overcome this limitation by utilizing a well-known data structure and by having developers describe its memory address using a configuration file that is passed to the benchmarking infrastructure. Following this concept, we extend D-Cube with the ability of building and applying patches to binary files and show that this allows not only to automatically change traffic patterns and node identities, but to also change user-defined protocol parameters. We believe that this extension is one of the last missing stepping stones to make D-Cube a full-fledged benchmarking infrastructure for low-power wireless systems.},

  abstract = {One of the major challenges for the engineering of wireless sensing systems is to improve the software abstractions and frameworks that are available to programmers while ensuring system reliability and efficiency. The distributed systems community have developed a rich set of such abstractions for building dependable distributed systems connected using wired networks, however after 20 years research many of these elude wireless sensor systems. In this paper we present X Process Commit (XPC) an atomic commit protocol framework that utilizes Synchronous Transmission (ST). We also introduce Hybrid, a technique that allows us to exploit the advantages of the Glossy and Chaos Synchronous Transmission primitives to get lower latency and higher reliability than either. Using XPC and Hybrid we demonstrate how to build protocols for the classical 2-phase and 3-phase commit abstractions and evaluate these demonstrating significantly improved performance and reliability than the use of Glossy or Chaos individually as dissemination primitives. We address how we overcame the timing challenges of bringing Glossy and Chaos together to form Hybrid and through extensive experimentation demonstrate that it is robust to in-network radio interference caused by multiple sources. We are first to present testbed results that show that Hybrid can provide almost 100\% reliability in a network of nodes suffering from various levels of radio interference.},

  abstract = {Sensor networks can be considered distributed computing platforms with many severe constraints, including limited CPU speed, memory size, power, and bandwidth. Individual nodes in sensor networks are typically unreliable and the network topology dynamically changes, possibly frequently. Sensor networks also differ because of their tight interaction with the physical environment via sensors and actuators. Because of this interaction, we find that sensor networks are very data-centric. Due to all of these differences, many solutions developed for general distributed computing platforms and for ad-hoc networks cannot be applied to sensor networks. After discussing several motivating applications, this paper first discusses the state of the art with respect to general research challenges, then focuses on more specific research challenges that appear in the networking, operating system, and middleware layers. For some of the research challenges, initial solutions or approaches are identified.},

  abstract = {Networks for real-time systems have stringent end-to-end latency and jitter requirements. One cost-efficient way to meet these requirements is the time-triggered communication paradigm which plans the transmission points in time of the frames off-line. This plan prevents contentions of frames on the network and is called a time-triggered schedule (tt-schedule). In general the tt-scheduling is a bin-packing problem, known to be NP-complete, where the complexity is mostly driven by the freedom in topology of the network, its associated hardware restrictions, and application-imposed constraints. Multi-hop networks, in particular, require the synthesis of path-dependent tt-schedules to maintain full determinism of time-triggered communication from sender to receiver. Our experiments using the YICES SMT solver show that the scheduling problem can be solved by YICES out-of-the-box for a few hundred random frame instances on the network. A customized tt-scheduler using YICES as a back-end solver allows to increase this number of frame instances up to tens of thousands. In terms of scheduling quality, the synthesis produces up to ninety percent maximum utilization on a communication link with schedule synthesis times of about half an hour for the biggest examples we have studied. As a nice side-effect the YICES out-of-the-box approach is immediately applicable for the verification of existing (even large-scale) tt-schedules and for debugging more sophisticated tt-schedulers.},

  abstract = {The wireless sensor network community is currently undergoing a platform paradigm shift, moving away from classical single-processor motes toward heterogeneous multi-processor architectures. These emerging platforms promise efficient concurrent processing with energy-proportional system performance. The use of shared interconnects and shared memory for inter-processor communication, however, causes interference in the time, power, and clock domains, which prevents designers from fully harnessing these benefits. We thus designed Bolt, the first ultra-low-power processor interconnect for the compositional construction of heterogeneous wireless embedded platforms. This paper presents the architectural blueprint for interconnecting two independent processors, while enabling asynchronous inter-processor communication with predictable run-time behavior. We detail a prototype implementation of Bolt, and apply formal methods to analytically derive bounds on the execution time of its message passing operations. Experiments with a custom-built dual-processor platform show that our Bolt prototype incurs a negligible power overhead relative to state-of-the-art platforms, offers predictable message passing with empirical bounds that match the analytical ones to within a few clock cycles, and achieves a high throughput of up to 3.3 Mbps.},

We construct Choco on Glossy, which is a recently presented efficient flooding scheme exploiting constructive-interference phenomena. Although Glossy is originally developed for flooding, it can be regarded as a networking primitive which provides low-power, low- delay, any-to-any communication reachability. In Choco, all packet transmissions are based on Glossy. A sink node explicitly schedules each node operation in a centralized and fine-grained manner with Glossy, and controls retransmission and power saving mode of each node. Each sensor node transmits data packets to the sink node with Glossy according to the request from the sink node. Although Choco is very simple mechanism, we reveal that Choco has considerable merits over current data collection protocols through two different testbed evaluations. Testbed evaluations demonstrate that Choco provides 14.7 times more energy-efficient collection than the state-of-the-art, while achieving end-to-end reliability for every node.},

We address hard real-time mixed-criticality applications, which may have different criticality levels, and we focus on the optimization of the communication configuration. TTEthernet integrates three types of traffic: Time-Triggered (TT) messages, Event-Triggered (ET) messages with bounded end-to-end delay, also called Rate Constrained (RC) messages, and Best-Effort (BE) messages, for which no timing guarantees are provided. TT messages are transmitted based on static schedule tables, and have the highest priority. RC messages are transmitted if there are no TT messages, and BE traffic has the lowest priority. TT and RC traffic can carry safety-critical messages, while BE messages are non-critical. Mixed-criticality tasks and messages can be integrated onto the same architecture only if there is enough spatial and temporal separation among them. TTEthernet offers spatial separation for mixed-criticality messages through the concept of virtual links, and temporal separation, enforced through schedule tables for TT messages and bandwidth allocation for RC messages. Given the set of mixed-criticality messages in the system and the topology of the virtual links on which the messages are transmitted, we are interested to synthesize offline the static schedules for the TT messages, such that the deadlines for the TT and RC messages are satisfied, and the end-to-end delay of the RC traffic is minimized. We have proposed a Tabu Search-based approach to solve this optimization problem. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated using several benchmarks.},

We propose Direct Code Execution (DCE), a framework that dramatically increases the number of available protocol models and realism available for ns-3 simulations. DCE meets the goals recently proposed for fully reproducible networking research and runnable papers, with the added benefits of 1) the ability of completely deterministic reproducibility, 2) the scalability that simulation time dilation offers, 3) capabilities supporting automated code coverage analysis, and 4) improved debuggability via execution within a single address space. In this paper, we describe in detail DCE, report on packet processing benchmarks and showcase key features of the framework with different use cases. We reproduce a previously published Multipath TCP (MPTCP) experiment and highlight how code coverage testing can be automated by showing results achieving 55-86\% coverage of the MPTCP implementation. Then we demonstrate how network stack debugging can be easily performed and reproduced across a distributed system. Our first benchmarks are promising and we believe this framework can benefit the network community by enabling realistic, reproducible experiments and runnable papers.},

  abstract = {The so-called Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is expected to transform our world, and in depth modernize very different domains such as manufacturing, energy, agriculture, construction industry, and other industrial sectors. The need for low power radio networks first led to low duty cycle approaches where nodes turn off their radio chipset most of the time to save energy. The medium access control (MAC) has thus been largely investigated over the last fifteen years. Unfortunately, classical contention access methods use a random access and are unable to provide guarantees. In the meantime, some dedicated standards have emerged (e.g. IEEE 802.15.4-2006, IEEE 802.15.4-2015), combining Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) with slow channel hopping in order to enable reliability and energy efficiency. Slow channel hopping allows each node to use different channels for a frame and its possible retransmissions with a low-cost hardware. To provide high-reliability, these protocols rely on a common schedule in order to prevent simultaneously interfering transmissions. In this context, we clearly observe a strong growth of the number of proposals in the last years, denoting a strong interest of the research community for deterministic slow channel hopping scheduling for the IIoT. We categorize here the numerous existing solutions according to their objectives (e.g. high-reliability, mobility support) and approaches. We also identify some open challenges, expected to attract much attention over the next few years.},

  abstract = {The Internet of Things is evolving, more and more devices are getting connected, more data exchanged and increasingly complex tasks are handled by these net- works. Especially, low-power wireless communication networks are widely used due to the flexibility and fast deployment with a battery. The networks must be at low cost and still guarantee a long battery life time and compute a com- plex task. The goal of this thesis is to evaluate the outsourcing of a potentially complex task, e.g. real-time scheduling, to another processor and enable a real- time functionality for the whole network. The goal is a proof of concepts of the scheduler outsourcing by evaluating the implementation at the system-level, combining hardware, scheduler and network protocol.  Many algorithms to support real-time functionalities are already developed, but the implementation for existing low-power systems with a single processor is difficult. Low power systems with a single core are often resource limited in memory and computational power. Multiple processors can be used to overcome this problem, but challenges with the interprocessor communication arises. The Dual-Processor Platform (DPP) enables a partition of the tasks between a very low-power communication processor (CP) and more powerful application processor (AP). The CP will be used to handle wireless communication based on the Low-power Wireless Bus (LWB), which is a best-effort network pro- tocol. The Blink scheduler is used to enable the real-time functionality in the network. The potentially complex and memory demanding Blink scheduler is outsourced to the AP. Further, the LWB round structure is adapted, which leverages the DPP platform and allows the computation of the next schedule on the AP while the communication is ongoing on the CP. Therefore, the delay for outsourcing the scheduler is becoming neglectable when the wireless network communication has sufficient many slots per round. In the end, the limitations like additional interprocessor communication delays are analysed and potential improvements are evaluated.},

However, how to support the development, maintenance, deployment and execution of applications over WSNs remains to be a nontrivial and challenging task, mainly because of the gap between the high level requirements from pervasive computing applications and the underlying operation of WSNs. Middleware for WSN can help bridge the gap and remove impediments. In recent years, research has been carried out on WSN middleware from different aspects and for different purposes. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the existing work on WSN middleware, seeking for a better understanding of the current issues and future directions in this field. We propose a reference framework to analyze the functionalities of WSN middleware in terms of the system abstractions and the services provided. We review the approaches and techniques for implementing the services. On the basis of the analysis and by using a feature tree, we provide taxonomy of the features of WSN middleware and their relationships, and use the taxonomy to classify and evaluate existing work. We also discuss open problems in this important area of research.},

  abstract = {Industrial control systems have traditionally been built around dedicated wired solutions. The requirements of flexibility, mobility, and cost have created a strong push toward wireless solutions, preferably solutions requiring low power. Simultaneously, the increased need for interoperability and integration with the wider Internet made a transition to IP-based communication unavoidable. Following these trends, we survey 6TiSCH, the emerging family of standards for IP-based industrial communication over low-power and lossy networks. We describe the state of the standardization work, the major issues being discussed, and open questions recently identified. Based on extensive first-hand experience, we discuss challenges in implementation of this new wave of standards. Lessons learned are highlighted from four popular open-source implementations of these standards: OpenWSN, Contiki, RIOT, and TinyOS. We outline major requirements, present insights from early interoperability testing and performance evaluations, and provide guidelines for chip manufacturers and implementers.},

This paper describes a unique {$>$}10-year data record obtained from in situ measurements in steep bedrock permafrost in an Alpine environment on the Matterhorn H{\"o}rnligrat, Zermatt, Switzerland, at 3500 m.a.s.l. Through the utilization of state-of-the-art wireless sensor technology it was possible to obtain more data of higher quality, make these data available in near real time and tightly monitor and control the running experiments. This data set (doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.897640) constitutes the longest, densest and most diverse data record in the history of mountain permafrost research worldwide with 17 different sensor types used at 29 distinct sensor locations consisting of over 114.5 million data points captured over a period of 10 or more years. By documenting and sharing these data in this form we contribute to making our past research reproducible and facilitate future research based on these data, e.g., in the areas of analysis methodology, comparative studies, assessment of change in the environment, natural hazard warning and the development of process models. Finally, the cross-validation of four different data types clearly indicates the dominance of thawing-related kinematics.},

  title = {Bin Packing Problem},
  author = {{Wikipedia}},
  year = {2019},
  abstract = {In the bin packing problem, items of different volumes must be packed into a finite number of bins or containers each of a fixed given volume in a way that minimizes the number of bins used. In computational complexity theory, it is a combinatorial NP-hard problem.  The decision problem (deciding if items will fit into a specified number of bins) is NP-complete.There are many variations of this problem, such as 2D packing, linear packing, packing by weight, packing by cost, and so on. They have many applications, such as filling up containers, loading trucks with weight capacity constraints, creating file backups in  media and technology mapping in field-programmable gate array semiconductor chip design.
The bin packing problem can also be seen as a special case of the cutting stock problem. When the number of bins is restricted to 1 and each item is characterised by both a volume and a value, the problem of maximising the value of items that can fit in the bin is known as the knapsack problem.
Despite the fact that the bin packing problem has an NP-hard computational complexity, optimal solutions to very large instances of the problem can be produced with sophisticated algorithms. In addition, many heuristics have been developed: for example, the first fit algorithm provides a fast but often non-optimal solution, involving placing each item into the first bin in which it will fit. It requires {$\Theta$}(n log n) time, where n is the number of items to be packed. The algorithm can be made much more effective by first sorting the list of items into decreasing order (sometimes known as the first-fit decreasing algorithm), although this still does not guarantee an optimal solution, and for longer lists may increase the running time of the algorithm. It is known, however, that there always exists at least one ordering of items that allows first-fit to produce an optimal solution.A variant of bin packing that occurs in practice is when items can share space when packed into a bin. Specifically,  a set of items could occupy less space when packed together than the sum of their individual sizes. This variant is known as VM packing since when virtual machines (VMs) are packed in a server, their total memory requirement could decrease due to pages shared by the VMs that need only be stored once. If items can share space in arbitrary ways, the bin packing problem is hard to even approximate. However, if the space sharing fits into a hierarchy, as is the case with memory sharing in virtual machines, the bin packing problem can be efficiently approximated.
Another variant of bin packing of interest in practice is the so-called online bin packing. Here the items of different volume are supposed to arrive sequentially and the decision maker has to decide whether to select and pack the currently observed item, or else to let it pass. Each decision is without recall.},

  title = {Linear Programming},
  author = {{Wikipedia}},
  year = {2019},
  abstract = {Linear programming (LP, also called linear optimization) is a method to achieve the best outcome (such as maximum profit or lowest cost) in a mathematical model whose requirements are represented by linear relationships. Linear programming is a special case of mathematical programming (also known as mathematical optimization).
More formally, linear programming is a technique for the optimization of a linear objective function, subject to linear equality and linear inequality constraints. Its feasible region is a convex polytope, which is a set defined as the intersection of finitely many half spaces, each of which is defined by a linear inequality. Its objective function is a real-valued affine (linear) function defined on this polyhedron. A linear programming algorithm finds a point in the polytope where this function has the smallest (or largest) value if such a point exists.
Linear programs are problems that can be expressed in canonical form as

   is the matrix transpose. The expression to be maximized or minimized is called the objective function (cTx in this case). The inequalities Ax {$\leq$} b and x {$\geq$} 0 are the constraints which specify a convex polytope over which the objective function is to be optimized. In this context, two vectors are comparable when they have the same dimensions. If every entry in the first is less-than or equal-to the corresponding entry in the second, then it can be said that the first vector is less-than or equal-to the second vector.
Linear programming can be applied to various fields of study. It is widely used in mathematics, and to a lesser extent in business, economics, and for some engineering problems. Industries that use linear programming models include transportation, energy, telecommunications, and manufacturing. It has proven useful in modeling diverse types of problems in planning, routing, scheduling, assignment, and design.},

We present a comprehensive mathematical model for MSK-modulated signals that makes the reasons explicit and thus provides fundamental insights into the key parameters governing the successful reception of colliding transmissions. A major contribution is the closed-form derivation of the receiver bit decision variable for an arbitrary number of colliding signals and constellations of power ratios, time offsets, and carrier phase offsets. We systematically explore the factors for successful packet delivery under concurrent transmissions across the whole parameter space of the model. We confirm the capture threshold behavior observed in previous studies but also reveal new insights relevant to the design of optimal protocols. We identify capture zones depending not only on the signal power ratio but also on time and phase offsets.},

A promising technique to achieve this goal is concurrent transmission, i.e. multiple nodes transmit identical or different packets in parallel. Practical implementations of concurrent transmission exist, yet its performance is not well understood due to the lack of expressive models that accurately predict the success of packet reception. We experimentally investigate the two phenomena that can occur during concurrent transmission depending on the transmission timing and signal strength, i.e. constructive interference and capture effect. Equipped with the thorough understanding of these two phenomena, we propose an accurate prediction model for the reception of concurrent transmission. The extensive measurements carried out with varying number of transmitters, packet length and signal strength verify the excellent quality of our model, which provides a valuable tool for protocol design and simulation of concurrent transmission in WSNs.},

However, utilizing this technology is still challenging due to the current low reliability of the standard WSN communication, e.g., large percentage of unreliable links, and the possibility of battery depletion and node failure. To overcome these difficulties we propose Sparkle, a WSN control network design based on concurrent transmission particularly oriented to periodic multi-loop control systems. It primarily draws on the Glossy protocol and inherits its advantages in high packet reliability, low latency and accurate time synchronization. The novelty of Sparkle is that it optimizes each end-to-end communication flow independently by performing "control" on the flow. Specifically, we show how to perform transmission power and topology controls. We introduce WSNShape, a unique topology control technique based on the capture effect, which drastically reduces energy while simultaneously improves packet reliability and latency, compared to Glossy. Finally, we design and implement PRRTrack, a component of Sparkle that can adaptively switch among various operation modes of different control strategies, thus trading-off reliability vs. energy consumption. Through evaluation on real-world testbeds, we demonstrate that Sparkle enables flows to satisfy the reliability requirement while reducing the energy consumption by in average 80\% and the latency by a further 5\% over the almost optimal latency of Glossy.},

  abstract = {The enormous potential for wireless sensor networks to make a positive impact on our society has spawned a great deal of research on the topic, and this research is now producing environment-ready systems. Current technology limits coupled with widely-varying application requirements lead to a diversity of hardware platforms for different portions of the design space. In addition, the unique energy and reliability constraints of a system that must function for months at a time without human intervention mean that demands on sensor network hardware are different from the demands on standard integrated circuits. This paper describes our experiences designing sensor nodes and low level software to control them. In the ZebraNet system we use GPS technology to record fine-grained position data in order to track long term animal migrations [14]. The ZebraNet hardware is composed of a 16-bit TI microcontroller, 4 Mbits of off-chip flash memory, a 900 MHz radio, and a low-power GPS chip. In this paper, we discuss our techniques for devising efficient power supplies for sensor networks, methods of managing the energy consumption of the nodes, and methods of managing the peripheral devices including the radio, flash, and sensors. We conclude by evaluating the design of the ZebraNet nodes and discussing how it can be improved. Our lessons learned in developing this hardware can be useful both in designing future sensor nodes and in using them in real systems.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we study time-triggered distributed systems where periodic application tasks are mapped onto different end stations (processing units) communicating over a switched Ethernet network. We address the problem of application level (i.e., both task- and network-level) schedule synthesis and optimization. In this context, most of the recent works [10], [11] either focus on communication schedule or consider a simplified task model. In this work, we formulate the co-synthesis problem of task and communication schedules as a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model taking into account a number of Ethernet-specific timing parameters such as interframe gap, precision and synchronization error. Our formulation is able to handle one or multiple timing objectives such as application response time, end-to-end delay and their combinations. We show the applicability of our formulation considering an industrial size case study using a number of different sets of objectives. Further, we show that our formulation scales to systems with reasonably large size.},

  abstract = {Concurrent transmissions, a novel communication paradigm, has been shown to effectively accomplish a reliable and energy-efficient flooding in wireless networks. With multiple nodes exploiting a receive-and-forward scheme in the network, this technique inevitably introduces communication redundancy and consequently raises the energy consumption of the nodes. In this paper, we propose LiM, an energy-efficient flooding protocol for wireless sensor networks. LiM builds on concurrent transmissions, exploiting constructive interference and the capture effect to achieve high reliability and low latency. Moreover, LiM equips itself with a machine learning capability to progressively reduce redundancy while maintaining high reliability. As a result, LiM is able to significantly reduce the radio-on time and therefore the energy consumption. We compare LiM with our baseline protocol Glossy by extensive experiments in the 30-node testbed FlockLab. Experimental results show that LiM highly reduces the broadcast redundancy in flooding. It outperforms the baseline protocol in terms of radio-on time, while attaining a high reliability of over 99.50\%, and an average end-to-end latency around 2 ms in all experimental scenarios.},

  abstract = {Mathematical models play a pivotal role in understanding and designing advanced low-power wireless systems. However, the distributed and uncoordinated operation of traditional multi-hop low-power wireless protocols greatly complicates their accurate modeling. This is mainly because these protocols build and maintain substantial network state to cope with the dynamics of low-power wireless links. Recent protocols depart from this design by leveraging synchronous transmissions (ST), whereby multiple nodes simultaneously transmit towards the same receiver, as opposed to pair wise link-based transmissions (LT). ST improve the one-hop packet reliability to an extent that efficient multi-hop protocols with little network state are feasible. This paper studies whether ST also enable simple yet accurate modeling of these protocols. Our contribution to this end is two-fold. First, we show, through experiments on a 139-node test bed, that characterizing packet receptions and losses as a sequence of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Bernoulli trials-a common assumption in protocol modeling but often illegitimate for LT-is largely valid for ST. We then show how this finding simplifies the modeling of a recent ST-based protocol, by deriving (i) sufficient conditions for probabilistic guarantees on the end-to-end packet reliability, and (ii) a Markovian model to estimate the long-term energy consumption. Validation using test bed experiments confirms that our simple models are also highly accurate, for example, the model error in energy against real measurements is 0.25\%, a figure never reported before in the related literature.},

  abstract = {Low-power wireless technology promises greater flexibility and lower costs in cyber-physical systems. To reap these benefits, communication protocols must deliver packets reliably within real-time deadlines across resource-constrained devices, while adapting to changes in application requirements (e.g., traffic demands) and network state (e.g., link qualities). Existing protocols do not solve all these challenges simultaneously, because their operation is either localized or a function of network state, which changes unpredictably over time. By contrast, this article claims a global approach that does not use network state information as input can overcome these limitations. The Blink protocol proves this claim by providing hard guarantees on end-to-end deadlines of received packets in multi-hop low-power wireless networks, while seamlessly handling changes in application requirements and network state. We build Blink on the non-real-time Low-Power Wireless Bus (LWB) and design new scheduling algorithms based on the earliest-deadline-first policy. Using a dedicated priority queue data structure, we demonstrate a viable implementation of our algorithms on resource-constrained devices. Experiments show that Blink (i) meets all deadlines of received packets, (ii) delivers 99.97\% of packets on a 94-node testbed, (iii) minimizes communication energy consumption within the limits of the underlying LWB, (iv) supports end-to-end deadlines of 100ms across four hops and nine sources, and (v) runs up to 4.1 \texttimes{} faster than a conventional scheduler implementation on popular microcontrollers.},
