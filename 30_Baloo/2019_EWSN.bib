  abstract = {An important building block for low-power wireless systems is to efficiently share and process data among all devices in a network. However, current approaches typically split such all-to-all interactions into sequential collection, processing, and dissemination phases, thus handling them inefficiently. We introduce Chaos, the first primitive that natively supports all-to-all data sharing in low-power wireless networks. Different from current approaches, Chaos embeds programmable in-network processing into a communication support based on synchronous transmissions. We show that this design enables a variety of common all-to-all interactions, including network-wide agreement and data aggregation. Results from three testbeds and simulations demonstrate that Chaos scales efficiently to networks consisting of hundreds of nodes, achieving severalfold improvements over LWB and CTP/Drip in radio duty cycle and latency with almost 100 \% reliability across all scenarios we tested. For example, Chaos computes simple aggregates, such as the maximum, in a 100-node multi-hop network within less than 90 milliseconds.},

However, in avionics, for ease of deployment, or for new functionality featuring mobile devices, there is a strong interest for wireless solutions. Low-power wireless protocols have been proposed, but requirements of a large class of CPS applications can still not be satisfied. This paper presents Time-Triggered-Wireless (TTW), a distributed low-power wireless system design that minimizes energy consumption and offers end-to-end timing predictability, adaptability, reliability, low latency. Our evaluation shows a reduction of communication latency by a factor 2x and of energy consumption by 33-40\% compared to state-of-the-art approaches. This validates the suitability of TTW for wireless CPS applications and opens the way for implementation and real-world experience with industry partners.},

Although these protocols (e.g., Glossy) have shown to be highly reliable for small packet sizes, the use of large packet sizes coupled with an excessive number of simultaneous transmissions can reduce reliability significantly. Our work is motivated by the observation that capture effect can improve the reliability of synchronous transmission. We experimentally study the effect of physical layer capture and identify guidelines in which it can be exploited to enhance reliability. Based on these observations, we propose Syncast, a data dissemination protocol that improves over Glossy by exploiting capture effect over multichannels. The evaluation shows that Syncast provides a robust, reliable, and scalable data dissemination of large packets with lower end-to-end delay and up to 92\% reduced radio-on-time.},

We present a novel programming abstraction called protothreads that makes it possible to write event-driven programs in a thread-like style, with a memory overhead of only two bytes per protothread. We show that protothreads significantly reduce the complexity of a number of widely used programs previously written with event-driven state machines. For the examined programs the majority of the state machines could be entirely removed. In the other cases the number of states and transitions was drastically decreased. With protothreads the number of lines of code was reduced by one third. The execution time overhead of protothreads is on the order of a few processor cycles.},

  doi = {10.1109/MASS.2016.018},
  abstract = {Typical Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) deployments use more nodes than needed to accurately sense the phenomena of interest. This redundancy can be leveraged by switching-on only a subset of nodes at any time instant (node-scheduling) and putting the remaining nodes sleep. This effectively extends the network lifetime. In addition to sensing coverage, node-scheduling schemes must also ensure that (i) the network stays connected, and (ii) the time needed to wake-up the complete protocol stack after sleeping is minimized. We present Sleeping Beauty, a highly-efficient data collection protocol that aids node-scheduling schemes in both aspects. Sleeping Beauty uses a slotted and tightly synchronized communication primitive, where a node keeps its radio off for most of the time, except in the slots when it needs to participate for successful communication. Further, an efficient neighbor-discovery mechanism is included that provides partial, but sufficient topology information (potential parents) to avoid network partitions. Furthermore, Sleeping Beauty employs a novel, yet simple clock-offset estimation technique that maintains highly-accurate time synchronization over long radio-off periods (i.e., less than 500 us deviation even after 45, min of sleeping). This minimizes time wasted in resynchronizing the network in between data collection rounds. Through experiments on two different testbeds, we verified that Sleeping Beauty decreases the duty cycle up to a factor of 3 compared to state-of-the-art techniques, while achieving similar delivery ratios.},

  abstract = {A large number of low-power wireless communication protocols has been proposed in the last decade by both academia and industry in an attempt to deliver information in an increasingly reliable, timely, and energy-efficient manner. However, their level of dependability has rarely been benchmarked under the same settings and environmental conditions. In this paper we present the execution and results of a competition aimed to evaluate the dependability of state-of-the-art low-power wireless protocols under the same settings, and push their performance to the limit. We define a scenario emulating the operation of a wireless sensor network in industrial environments rich with radio interference and compare the end-to-end dependability of systems based on protocol strategies ranging from adaptive and time-slotted frequency-hopping to multi-modal routing and flooding. To increase fairness and realism, we allow the developers of the competing protocols to interact with the benchmarking infrastructure and optimize the protocol parameters for the scenario at hand. We achieve this by designing, implementing, and employing D-Cube, a low-cost tool that allows to accurately measure key dependability metrics such as end-to-end delay, reliability, and power consumption, as well as to graphically visualize their evolution in real-time. This interaction with the benchmarking infrastructure and the competitiveness of the event have incited the developers to push the performance of their protocols to the limit and reach impressive results.},

Recently, much attention in literature is aimed at what we define as 'centralised' middleware components, which consider sensor networks that have no capacity to run middleware components on the sensor nodes. In this paper we introduce the term 'centralised' for these middleware components, and illustrate their relevance using a literature review of existing middleware components. After an overview of their general architectural setup, we describe and discuss four important centralised middleware components.

Middleware for WSN can help bridge the gap and remove impediments. In recent years, research has been carried out on WSN middleware from different aspects and for different purposes. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of the existing work on WSN middleware, seeking for a better understanding of the current issues and future directions in this field.

The recent Crystal system uses synchronous transmissions to support aperiodic traffic with near-perfect reliability, low latency, and ultra-low power consumption. However, its performance is known under mild interference---a concern, as Crystal relies heavily on the (noise-sensitive) capture effect and targets aperiodic traffic where "every packet counts". We exploit a 49-node indoor testbed where, in contrast to existing evaluations using only naturally present interference to evaluate synchronous systems, we rely on JamLab to generate noise patterns that are not only more disruptive and extensive, but also reproducible. We show that a properly configured, unmodified Crystal yields perfect reliability (unlike Glossy) in several noise scenarios, but cannot sustain extreme ones (e.g., an emulated microwave oven near the sink) that instead are handled by routing-based approaches. We extend Crystal with techniques known to mitigate interference---channel hopping and noise detection---and demonstrate that these allow Crystal to achieve performance akin to the original even under multiple sources of strong interference.},

Glossy exploits constructive interference of IEEE 802.15.4 symbols for fast network flooding and implicit time synchronization. We derive a timing requirement to make concurrent transmissions of the same packet interfere constructively, allowing a receiver to decode the packet even in the absence of capture effects. To satisfy this requirement, our design temporally decouples flooding from other network activities. We analyze Glossy using a mixture of statistical and worst-case models, and evaluate it through experiments under controlled settings and on three wireless sensor testbeds. Our results show that Glossy floods packets within a few milliseconds and achieves an average time synchronization error below one microsecond. In most cases, a node receives the flooding packet with a probability higher than 99.99\%, while having its radio turned on for only a few milliseconds during a flood. Moreover, unlike existing flooding schemes, Glossy's performance exhibits no noticeable dependency on node density, which facilitates its application in diverse real-world settings.},

Distributed consensus protocols is a mature field of research in a wired context, but has received little attention in low-power wireless settings. In this paper, we present A2: Agreement in the Air, a system that brings distributed consensus to low-power multi-hop networks. A2 introduces Synchrotron, a synchronous transmissions kernel that builds a robust mesh by exploiting the capture effect, frequency hopping with parallel channels, and link-layer security. A2 builds on top of this reliable base layer and enables the two- and three-phase commit protocols, as well as network services such as group membership, hopping sequence distribution and re-keying. We evaluate A2 on four public testbeds with different deployment densities and sizes. A2 requires only 475 ms to complete a two-phase commit over 180 nodes. The resulting duty cycle is 0.5\% for 1-minute intervals. We show that A2 achieves zero losses end-to-end over long experiments, representing millions of data points. When adding controlled failures, we show that two-phase commit ensures transaction consistency in A2 while three-phase commit provides liveness at the expense of inconsistency under specific failure scenarios.},

  abstract = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are increasingly being applied to scenarios that simultaneously demand for high packet reliability and short delay. A promising technique to achieve this goal is concurrent transmission, i.e. multiple nodes transmit identical or different packets in parallel. Practical implementations of concurrent transmission exist, yet its performance is not well understood due to the lack of expressive models that accurately predict the success of packet reception. We experimentally investigate the two phenomena that can occur during concurrent transmission depending on the transmission timing and signal strength, i.e. constructive interference and capture effect. Equipped with the thorough understanding of these two phenomena, we propose an accurate prediction model for the reception of concurrent transmission. The extensive measurements carried out with varying number of transmitters, packet length and signal strength verify the excellent quality of our model, which provides a valuable tool for protocol design and simulation of concurrent transmission in WSNs.},

Pando encodes data by Fountain codes and disseminates the rateless stream of encoded packets along the fast and parallel pipelines built on constructive interference and channel diversity. Since every encoded packet contains innovative information to the original data object, Pando avoids duplicate retransmissions and fully exploits the wireless broadcast effect in data dissemination. To transform Pando into a practical system, we devise several techniques, including the integration of Fountain coding with the timing-critical operations of constructive interference and pipelining, a silence based feedback scheme for the one-way pipelined dissemination, and packet-level adaptation of network density and channel diversity. Based on these techniques, Pando can accomplish the data dissemination process entirely over the fast and parallel pipelines. We implement Pando in Contiki and for TelosB sensor motes. We evaluate Pando's performance with various settings on two large-scale open testbeds, Indriya and Flocklab. Our experimental results show that Pando can provide 100\% reliability and reduce the dissemination time of the state-of-the-art by 3.5.},

Recent technological advances have made it possible to run such protocols on resource-constrained devices. Yet these devices often use energy-efficient, low-level communication technologies, like IEEE 802.15.4, which suffer from low-reliability and high latency. These drawbacks can be significantly reduced if communication occurs using concurrent transmissions - a novel communication paradigm for resource-constrained devices. In this paper, we show that Internet protocols like TCP/UDP and CoAP can run efficiently on top of a routing substrate based on concurrent transmissions. We call this substrate LaneFlood and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments on Flocklab, a publicly available testbed. Our results show that LaneFlood improves upon CXFS - a representative competitor - in terms of both duty cycle and reliability. Furthermore, LaneFlood can transport IoT traffic with an end-to-end latency of less than 300 ms over several hops.},

This paper evaluates the current state of the art of proposed QoS approaches in the IoT, specifically: (1) What layers of the IoT architecture have had the most research on QoS? (2) What quality factors do the quality approaches take into account when measuring performance? (3) What types of research have been conducted in this area? We have conducted a systematic mapping using a number of automated searches from the most relevant academic databases to address these questions. This mapping has identified a number of state of the art approaches which provides a good reference for researchers. The paper also identifies a number of gaps in the research literature at specific layers of the IoT architecture. It identifies which quality factors, research and contribution facets have been underutilised in the state of the art.},

TeenyLime provides programmers with the high-level abstraction of a tuple space, enabling data sharing among neighboring devices. These and other WSN-specific constructs simplify the development of a wide range of applications, including sense-and-react ones. TeenyLime yields simpler, cleaner, and more reusable implementations, at the cost of only a very limited decrease in performance. We support these claims through a source-level, quantitative comparison between implementations based on TeenyLime and on mainstream approaches, and by analyzing measures of processing overhead and power consumption obtained through cycle-accurate emulation.},

  abstract = {Application development in the Internet of Things (IoT) is challenging because it involves dealing with a wide range of related issues such as lack of separation of concerns, and lack of high-level of abstractions to address both the large scale and heterogeneity. Moreover, stakeholders involved in the application development have to address issues that can be attributed to different life-cycles phases. when developing applications. First, the application logic has to be analyzed and then separated into a set of distributed tasks for an underlying network. Then, the tasks have to be implemented for the specific hardware. Apart from handling these issues, they have to deal with other aspects of life-cycle such as changes in application requirements and deployed devices. Several approaches have been proposed in the closely related fields of wireless sensor network, ubiquitous and pervasive computing, and software engineering in general to address the above challenges. However, existing approaches only cover limited subsets of the above mentioned challenges when applied to the IoT. This paper proposes an integrated approach for addressing the above mentioned challenges. The main contributions of this paper are: (1) a development methodology that separates IoT application development into different concerns and provides a conceptual framework to develop an application, (2) a development framework that implements the development methodology to support actions of stakeholders. The development framework provides a set of modeling languages to specify each development concern and abstracts the scale and heterogeneity related complexity. It integrates code generation, task-mapping, and linking techniques to provide automation. Code generation supports the application development phase by producing a programming framework that allows stakeholders to focus on the application logic, while our mapping and linking techniques together support the deployment phase by producing device-specific code to result in a distributed system collaboratively hosted by individual devices. Our evaluation based on two realistic scenarios shows that the use of our approach improves the productivity of stakeholders involved in the application development.},

FlockLab's accurate timing information in the low microsecond range enables logical events to be correlated with power samples, thus providing a previously unattained level of visibility into the distributed behavior of wireless embedded systems.

  abstract = {Sensor networks are long-running computer systems with many sensing/compute nodes working to gather information about their environment, process and fuse that information, and in some cases, actuate control mechanisms in response. Like traditional parallel systems, communication between nodes is of fundamental importance, but is typically accomplished via wireless transceivers. One further key attribute of sensor networks is that they are almost always long running systems, intended to operate in situ, with minimal direct human intervention, for months or years. This requirement for long-running autonomy mandates careful design of the runtime system that manages applications on each node, to ensure reliability and ease of upgrades over the life of the system.This paper describes Impala, a middleware architecture that enables application modularity, adaptivity, and repair-ability in wireless sensor networks. Impala allows software updates to be received via the node's wireless transceiver and to be applied to the running system dynamically. In addition, Impala also provides an interface for on-the-fly application adaptation in order to improve the performance, energy-efficiency, and reliability of the software system. Impala has been designed to be a part of the ZebraNet mobile sensor network, but we are also prototyping it within HP/Compaq iPAQ Pocket PC handhelds. We present performance data for both real system measurements of the Pocket PC version as well as simulations of a full mobile sensor system deployment. Overall, Impala is a lightweight runtime system that can greatly improve system reliability, performance, and energy-efficiency. The ideas introduced here for sensor networks have applicability more broadly in other long-running autonomous parallel systems as well.},

  abstract = {Many applications such as autonomous swarming drones and system services like data replication need to exchange data among many or all nodes in a network. However, wireless many-to-many broadcast has thus far only been studied theoretically or in simulation, and practical solutions hardly meet the requirements of emerging applications, especially in terms of latency. This paper presents Mixer, a communication primitive that provides fast and reliable many-to-many broadcast in dynamic wireless multi-hop networks. Mixer integrates random linear network coding with synchronous transmissions to simultaneously disseminate all messages in the network. To deliver the performance gains our approach enables, we design Mixer's protocol logic in response to the physical-layer characteristics and the theory of network coding. First results from testbed experiments demonstrate that, compared with the state of the art, Mixer is up to 65\% faster and reduces radio-on time by up to 50\%, while providing a message delivery rate above 99.9\%.},

  abstract = {Most current WSN MAC protocol implementations have multiple tasks to perform--deciding on correct timing, sending of packets, sending of acknowledgements, etc. However, as much of this is common to all MAC protocols, there is duplication of functionality, which leads to larger MAC protocol code size and therefore increasing numbers of bugs. Additionally, extensions to the basic functionality must be separately implemented in each MAC protocol. In this paper, we look at a different way to design a MAC protocol, focusing on the providing of interfaces which can be used to implement the common functionality separately. This leaves the core of the MAC protocol, determining only when to send, which is substantially different for each protocol. We also look at some examples of MAC extensions that this approach enables. We demonstrate a working implementation of these principles as an implementation of B-MAC for TinyOS, and compare it with the standard TinyOS B-MAC implementation. We show a 35\% smaller code size, with the same overall functionality but increased extensibility, and while maintaining similar performance. We also present results and experiences from using the same framework to implement T-MAC, LMAC, and Crankshaft. All are demonstrated with data from real-world experience using our 24 node testbed.},

The approach is based on the temporal decoupling of the different tasks of a sensor node such that at any time at most one task is active. In contrast to traditional sensor network programming, slotted programming guarantees that each of these tasks can be implemented as an independent software module, simplifying not only the coding and testing phase, but also the code reuse in a different context. In addition, we believe that the proposed approach is highly qualified for energy efficient and real time applications. To substantiate our claims, we have implemented slotos, an extension to TinyOS that supports slotted programming. Within this framework, we demonstrate the advantages of the slotted programming paradigm.},

This makes system development and evolution difficult since developers cannot use the same simulator for both high-level algorithm development and low-level development such as device-driver implementations. We propose cross-level simulation, a novel type of wireless sensor network simulation that enables holistic simultaneous simulation at different levels. We present an implementation of such a simulator, COOJA, a simulator for the Contiki sensor node operating system. COOJA allows for simultaneous simulation at the network level, the operating system level, and the machine code instruction set level. With COOJA, we show the feasibility of the cross-level simulation approach},

Building new MAC protocols has proven to be extremely difficult, however, given the monolithic nature of existing protocol implementations as well as their dependence on a particular radio or processor platform. To address these issues, we propose the MAC Layer Architecture (MLA), a component-based architecture for power-efficient MAC protocol development in wireless sensor networks. MLA consists of optimized, reusable components that implement a common set of features shared by existing MAC protocols, as well as abstractions that encapsulate the intricacies of the hardware platforms they run on. Through an instantiation of MLA in TinyOS 2.0.1, we have implemented five representative MAC protocols. Empirical results show that MLA results in significant code reuse among different protocols, while achieving comparative performance and memory footprints to monolithic implementations of the same protocols.},

We construct Choco on Glossy, which is a recently presented efficient flooding scheme exploiting constructive-interference phenomena. Although Glossy is originally developed for flooding, it can be regarded as a networking primitive which provides low-power, low- delay, any-to-any communication reachability. In Choco, all packet transmissions are based on Glossy. A sink node explicitly schedules each node operation in a centralized and fine-grained manner with Glossy, and controls retransmission and power saving mode of each node. Each sensor node transmits data packets to the sink node with Glossy according to the request from the sink node. Although Choco is very simple mechanism, we reveal that Choco has considerable merits over current data collection protocols through two different testbed evaluations. Testbed evaluations demonstrate that Choco provides 14.7 times more energy-efficient collection than the state-of-the-art, while achieving end-to-end reliability for every node.},

  abstract = {The so-called Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is expected to transform our world, and in depth modernize very different domains such as manufacturing, energy, agriculture, construction industry, and other industrial sectors. The need for low power radio networks first led to low duty cycle approaches where nodes turn off their radio chipset most of the time to save energy. The medium access control (MAC) has thus been largely investigated over the last fifteen years. Unfortunately, classical contention access methods use a random access and are unable to provide guarantees. In the meantime, some dedicated standards have emerged (e.g. IEEE 802.15.4-2006, IEEE 802.15.4-2015), combining Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) with slow channel hopping in order to enable reliability and energy efficiency. Slow channel hopping allows each node to use different channels for a frame and its possible retransmissions with a low-cost hardware. To provide high-reliability, these protocols rely on a common schedule in order to prevent simultaneously interfering transmissions. In this context, we clearly observe a strong growth of the number of proposals in the last years, denoting a strong interest of the research community for deterministic slow channel hopping scheduling for the IIoT. We categorize here the numerous existing solutions according to their objectives (e.g. high-reliability, mobility support) and approaches. We also identify some open challenges, expected to attract much attention over the next few years.},

  abstract = {Wireless low-power technologies have been the focus of a large research effort, for example, in the wireless sensor network and other short range technologies domains. Although bringing extended autonomy to battery powered stations, such technologies are known to be negatively influenced by similar technologies contending for the medium and, especially, by technologies using higher power transmissions over the same frequency bands. A frequency band that is becoming increasingly crowded with competing technologies is the 2.4GHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical band, encompassing, for example, Bluetooth and ZigBee, two low-power communication standards which are the base of several real-time protocols. Although these technologies employ mechanisms to improve their coexistence, they are still vulnerable to transmissions from uncoordinated stations with similar technologies or to higher power technologies such as Wi- Fi, which hinders the support of wireless dependable real-time communications in open environments. Therefore, this survey presents a comprehensive study of the most commonly used wireless low-power technologies operating in the 2.4GHz Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band and real-time protocols built upon them. The survey of the real-time protocols using these technologies is focused on factory automation applications, due to their more demanding timeliness and reliability requirements.},

Given the limited number of license-free Industrial, Scientific, and Medical (ISM) radio bands, wireless technologies end up competing with one another for the wireless spectrum. As such, the proper employment of Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols is essential to guarantee efficient and reliable wireless communication. At the data link level, there has been extensive research towards programmable and more future-proof MAC protocols (e.g., Software-Defined Radios (SDRs), which enable to reconfigure the entire protocol and hence access/control fine-grained radio functionalities). However, actual deployments are so far limited because of performance issues and cost. With the increasing popularity of Software-Defined Networking (SDN), also in the wireless domain, and the increasing performance of SDRs, we are evolving into a fully programmable data link layer. In this survey, we deliver: a landscape of the state-of-the-art on programmable MAC protocols; a coherent terminology that represents scope and level of programmability supported; an in-depth study of their advantages and disadvantages; and a discussion about future research challenges on MAC programmability. Many surveys have investigated the use of specific MAC protocols for a wide range of optimization criteria and application demands. This survey is the first that investigates the scope and the level of programmability that MAC protocols support.},

  abstract = {Concurrent transmissions, a novel communication paradigm, has been shown to effectively accomplish a reliable and energy-efficient flooding in wireless networks. With multiple nodes exploiting a receive-and-forward scheme in the network, this technique inevitably introduces communication redundancy and consequently raises the energy consumption of the nodes. In this paper, we propose LiM, an energy-efficient flooding protocol for wireless sensor networks. LiM builds on concurrent transmissions, exploiting constructive interference and the capture effect to achieve high reliability and low latency. Moreover, LiM equips itself with a machine learning capability to progressively reduce redundancy while maintaining high reliability. As a result, LiM is able to significantly reduce the radio-on time and therefore the energy consumption. We compare LiM with our baseline protocol Glossy by extensive experiments in the 30-node testbed FlockLab. Experimental results show that LiM highly reduces the broadcast redundancy in flooding. It outperforms the baseline protocol in terms of radio-on time, while attaining a high reliability of over 99.50\%, and an average end-to-end latency around 2 ms in all experimental scenarios.},
